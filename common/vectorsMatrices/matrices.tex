\subsection{Matrices}
\noindent
Matrices are an array of mathematical objects, most often numbers.
They are often used to represent linear transformations between two spaces and systems of linear equations.
We denote the size of a matrix by saying the number of rows followed by the number of columns.

\begin{example}
	Below is a 2 x 4 matrix.
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{bmatrix}
			1 & 3 & 2 & -1 \\
			-5 & 7 & 3 & 0 \\
		\end{bmatrix}
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}
