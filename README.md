# Math-Summaries
These are LaTeX summaries of various math courses. They are meant to be longer and more in-depth than a formula sheet and also shorter and less formal than a textbook.

## Multivaraible Calculus (multiCalc)
This covers topics typically found and an undergraduate multivaraible calculus course, like multiple integrals, Green's Theorems, and Stokes's Theorem.
The chapters are:
1. Background & Review
2. Vector-Valued Functions (VVFs)
3. Differential Multivariable Calculus
4. Multiple Integrals
5. Curvilinear Coordinates
6. Line and Surface Integrals
7. Vector Analysis
8. Additional Materials

## Differential Equations (diffEq)
This covers topics typically found in an undergraduate introductory differential equations course. Most discussion is limited to Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs).
The chapters are:
1. Background & Review
2. The Basics of Differential Equations
3. 1st Order Linear ODE's
4. Higher Order ODE's
5. Linear Systems of Differential Equations
6. Laplace Transforms
7. Additional Resources

## How to Compile (make into a PDF)
Simply download the folders for each work you like to build and compile the main.tex file using a tool like pdfLaTeX. Most LaTeX IDEs (like TeXStudio) have this functionality built-in.

## How to Contribute
The easiest way to contribute is to fork the repository, make your changes in the LaTeX documents, and submit a pull request. However, if you don't know LaTeX, there are till other ways to contribute. One of the most-needed non-LaTeX items are figures: to avoid copyright claims, images should either be created by contributors themselves the public domain.

## Notes
* The differential equations work has the option to not include certain sections when compiled to a PDF. By default, all chapters are included, but examples from the Background & Review chapter are not included. If you would like to change these options before compiling change the delevant \\def line in the main.tex file.
