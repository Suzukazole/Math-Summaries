\subsection{Basic Properties}
All of these properties should look familiar from properties of limits and continuity.
Let $f$ and $g$ be differentiable functions of $x$.
Let $c$ be some real constant.
\begin{align*}
	\textbf{Sum and Difference Rule: }& (f \pm g)^\prime = f^\prime \pm g^\prime \\
	\textbf{Constant Multiple Rule: }& (cf)^\prime = cf^\prime \\
	\textbf{Constant Rule: }& (c)^\prime = 0
\end{align*}
\footnotetext{This follows from using the sum and difference rule with the power rule.}
