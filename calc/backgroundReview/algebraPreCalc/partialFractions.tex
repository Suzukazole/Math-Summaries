\subsection{Partial Fractions}

If we have a function that is the quotient of two polynomials $f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, it's often easier to break this quotient into a sum of parts where the denominator is a linear or quadratic factor and the numerator is always a smaller polynomial degree than the denominator.

One natural way to find these small denominators comes from the linear factors of the denominator where we keep complex roots in quadratic form.
This way, when making a common denominator, we get back the original big denominator.
However, there are a few special cases we have to take care of.
