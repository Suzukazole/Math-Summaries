	\item Water is pumped into a tank at a rate modeled by $W(t)=2000e^{-t^2/20}$ liters per hour for $0 \leq t \leq 8$, where $t$ is measured in hours.
	Water is removed from the tank at a rate modeled by $R(t)$ liters per hour, where $R$ is differentiable and decreasing on $0 \leq t \leq 8$.
	Selected values of $R(t)$ are shown in the table above.
	At time $t=0$, there are 50000 liters of water in the tank.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Estimate $R^\prime(2)$.
		Show the work that leads to your answer.
		Indicate units of measure.
		\item Use a left Riemann sum with the four subintervals indicated by the table to estimate the total amount of water removed from the tank during the 8 hours.
		Is this an over estimate or underestimate of the total amount of water removed?
		Give a reason for your answer.
		\item Use your answer from part (b) to find an estimate for the total amount of water in the tank, to the nearest liters, at the end of the 8 hours.
		\item For $0 \leq t \leq 8$, is there a time $t$ when the rate at which the water is pumped into the tank is the same rate as the rate at which water is removed from the tank?
		Explain why or why not.
