\section{Online Resources}
Below is a list of other useful resources for learning single variable calculus.
Most are freely available online.

\begin{itemize}
	\item \href{https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcI/CalcI.aspx}{Paul's Online Notes, Calculus I} -- Covers first ``half" of single variable calculus, including derivatives and definite integrals.
	\item \href{https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/Classes/CalcII/CalcII.aspx}{Paul's Online Notes, Calculus I} -- Covers second ``half" of single variable calculus, including improper integrals, parametric and polar functions, and series.
	\item \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-bc}{Khan Academy, AP Calculus BC} -- Video lectures and practice problems that should cover the same material as in this book.
		There is also resources for \href{https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab}{AP Calculus AB} which covers many of the same, but fewer topics than BC.
	\item \href{https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/}{MIT OCW 18.01} Complete series of lectures, recitations, assignments, practice problems, lecture notes, and exams needed for independent study.
	\item Finney, Demana, Waits, and Kennedy: \textit{Calculus: Graphical, Numerical, Algebraic} -- Common textbook for AB and BC students.
		Contains explinations, practice problems, and tips for the AP exams.
