\subsection{Linearity}
\noindent
We already know from calculus that the integral is a linear operator.
That is, scalar multiplication can be pulled out of the integral, and the integral of the sum of two functions is the same as the sum of the integrals of the functions.
Since the Laplace transform is just an integral, it is also a linear operator.
So we can say
\begin{equation*}
	\Laplace{cf + g} = c\Laplace{f} + \Laplace{g} \text{, } c \in \R.
\end{equation*}
