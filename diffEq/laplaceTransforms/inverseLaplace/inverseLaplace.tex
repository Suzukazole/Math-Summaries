\section{Inverse Laplace Transforms}
\noindent
Similar to how the derivative is the inverse of the integral, we can think about an inverse Laplace transform that allows us to go back from the $s$ domain to the $t$ domain.
\begin{definition}
	Let $F(s) = \Laplace{f(t)}$. Then $f(t)$ is the inverse Laplace transform of $F(s)$.
	\begin{equation*}
		\inverseLaplace{F(s)} = \inverseLaplace{\Laplace{f(t)}} = f(t)
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}

\noindent
We don't need to work through the derivations of inverse Laplace transforms because we already did the derivations for Laplace transforms.
