\subsection{Ordinary vs. Partial}
\noindent
Another useful classification is by the type. There are two broad types of differential equation: ordinary and partial.
\begin{definition}
	An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation where only 1 independent variable involved in the derivatives.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	A partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation where 2 or more independent variables are involved in the derivative.
\end{definition}
\noindent
Below is a table of types and equation numbers.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c}
		Type & Equation Number \\
		\hline
		ODE &  1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 \\
		PDE & 3, 4, 9 \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
We'll work mostly with ODEs.
