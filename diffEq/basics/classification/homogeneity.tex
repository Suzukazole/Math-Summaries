\subsection{Homogeneity}
\begin{definition}
	A differential equation is homogeneous if all terms involve the dependent variable or its derivatives.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Below is a table of homogeneity and equation numbers.
\begin{table}[H]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{c|c}
		Homogeneity & Equation Number \\
		\hline
		Homogeneous &  3, 7, 8 \\
		Heterogeneous & 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10 \\
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\noindent
Homogeneous equations have some nice properties, like always having at least a trivial solution of 0.
