\begin{example}
	Does a solution to the following IVP exist? Is it unique?
	\begin{equation*}
		\begin{cases}
			\dd{y}{x} = x^2 - xy^3 \\
			y(1) = 6
		\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}
\noindent
$f(x,y) = x^2 - xy^3$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = -3xy^2$ are continuous on all of $\R^2$. So, the existence and uniqueness theorem tells us that the IVP has a unique solution on an open interval containing $x_0 = 1$.

\begin{example}
	Does a solution to the following IVP exist? Is it unique?
	\begin{equation*}
	\begin{cases}
		\dd{y}{x} = 3y^{2/3} \\
		y(2) = 0
	\end{cases}
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}
\noindent
$f(x,y) = 3y^{2/3}$ is continuous on $y \in \R$, and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 2y^{-1/3}$ is continuous on $x \in \left(-\infty, 0\right) \cup \left(0, \infty\right)$. Since $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ is not continuous on a domain containing $(2,0)$, the existence and uniqueness theorem does not guarantee a solution.
