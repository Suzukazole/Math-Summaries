\noindent
A differential equation is an equation that relates a function to its derivatives.

The three classes of order, linearity, and type are how we describe differential equations in words. Equation 1 would be described as a "1st order linear ODE". These definitions also allow us to define explicitly how an nth order linear ODE looks.


\begin{definition}
	An $n$th order linear ODE has the form
	\begin{equation*}
	a_n(x)\frac{\mathrm{d}^n y}{\mathrm{d} x^n} + a_{n-1}(x)\frac{\mathrm{d}^{n-1} y}{\mathrm{d} x^{n-1}} + \ldots + a_0(x)y = b(x).
	\end{equation*}
\end{definition}
