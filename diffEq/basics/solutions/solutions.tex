\section{Solutions to Differential Equations}
\begin{definition}
	A solution to an ODE on an interval is a function $f$ that makes the differential equation true on the interval when $f$ is substituted into the equation.
\end{definition}
\noindent
Although this definition seems straightforward it gives us a formal way to check if a function is a solution to a differential equation.
