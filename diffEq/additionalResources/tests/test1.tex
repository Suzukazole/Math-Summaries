\subsection{Test 1}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]
	\item 
		Determine if $y - ln{y} = x^2 + 1$ is an implicit solution to $\dd{y}{x} = \frac{2xy}{y-1}$. Give reasons for your answer.
	\item 
		Find the function $y(x)$ that satisfies the differential equation
		\begin{equation*}
			\dd{y}{x} + 4y - e^{-x} = 0 \text{ and } y(0) = \frac{4}{3}
		\end{equation*}
	\item
		Find the solution to the initial value problem $\dd{y}{x} = x\frac{(t-3)^2}{x+2} \text{, } x(3) = -1$. You may leave the solution in implicit form.
	\item
		Find the general solution to the differential equation $y''' + y'' - 2y = 0$.
	\item
		A tank contains 90kg of salt and 2000L of water. Pure water enters the tank at a rate of 3L/min. The solutions is mixed and drains from the tank at a rate of 6L/min.
		\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
			\item
				What is the amount of salt in the tank initially?
			\item 
				Find the amount of salt in the tank after 2 hours.
		\end{enumerate}
	\item
		A detective arrives at a murder scene at noon that has an ambient temperature of $16^{\circ}$C. He measures the temperature of the body as $34^{\circ}$C. He then returns an hour later and measures the temperature of the body as $32^{\circ}$C.
		Assuming the normal body temperature is $37^{\circ}$C, write a differential equation using Newton's law of cooling that models the situation. Solve this equation using the conditions given to find at what time the murder took place.
