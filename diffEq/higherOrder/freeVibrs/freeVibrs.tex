\section{Free Vibrations}
\noindent
Free damped vibrations, like in a massed spring system, are a common application of second order linear ODEs.
In a massed spring system, there are three main forces acting on the mass that make up external forces.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*)]
	\item Acceleration of The Mass -- Since acceleration is the 2nd derivative of position $y(t)$, and Newton's Second Law tells us that $F = ma$, the force from the acceleration of the mass is $my''$.
	\item Dampening -- We'll assume that this term is proportional to the velocity, $y'$, and a term $b$. So, the force from dampening is $by'$.
	\item Spring Stretch -- Hooke's Law tells us that the force from a spring is $ky$, where $k$ is some term that gives the spring's "stiffness"
\end{enumerate}
Since we assume that the net force is 0 (that's what free means), our equations is
\begin{equation*}
	my'' + by' + ky = 0.
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Extracting the coefficients and solving the auxiliary equation,
\begin{equation*}
	mr^2 + br + k = 0 \implies r = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4mk}}{2m}.
\end{equation*}
We will consider two cases.
One in which there is no damping ($b = 0$), and one in which there is damping ($b > 0$).
