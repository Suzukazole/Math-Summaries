\subsubsection{Critically Damped ($\Delta = 0$)}
This case isn't much more difficult. The only difference is that because both roots $r_1$ and $r_2$ are $\frac{-b}{2m}$, we need an extra $t$ term in the solution. So, out solution is
\begin{equation*}
	y = C_1e^{r_1 t} + C_2te^{r_2 t}
\end{equation*}

\end{center}
Since both roots are once again negative,
\begin{equation*}
\lim\limits_{t \to 0}{C_1e^{r_1 t} + C_2te^{r_2 t}} = 0
\end{equation*}
meaning the mass's oscillation decays over time.
