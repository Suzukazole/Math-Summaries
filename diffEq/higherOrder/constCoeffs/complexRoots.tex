\subsubsection{Complex Roots}
\noindent
Although the previous two theorems already cover complex roots, we can simplify solutions that have complex roots into functions we more easily understand.\\

\begin{theorem}
	If an auxillary equation has roots $\alpha \pm \beta i$, then $C_1e^{\alpha x}\cos{(\beta x)}$ and  $C_2e^{\alpha x}\sin{(\beta x)}$ are fundamental solutions.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	The two corresponding fundamental solutions are
	\begin{equation*}
		C_1e^{(\alpha + \beta i)x} \text{, } C_2e^{(\alpha - \beta i)x}
	\end{equation*}
	so the part of the general solution for these two fundamental solutions are
	\begin{equation*}
		C_1e^{(\alpha + \beta i)x} + C_2e^{(\alpha - \beta i)x}
	\end{equation*}
	Using Euler's formula, we can also write this as
	\begin{equation*}
		C_1 e^{\alpha x}\left( \cos{(\beta t)} + i\sin{(\beta x)} \right) + C_2e^{\alpha x}\left( \cos{(-\beta x)} + i\sin{(-\beta x)} \right)
	\end{equation*}
	Using the fact that $\sin{(-x)} = -\sin{x}$, $\cos{(-x)} = -\cos{x}$ and separating into real and imaginary parts,
	\begin{equation*}
		 = \left[ C_1e^{\alpha x}\cos{(\beta x)} + C_2e^{\alpha x}\cos{(\beta x)} \right] + i\left[ C_1e^{\alpha x}\sin{(\beta x)} - C_2e^{\alpha x}\sin{(\beta x)} \right]
	\end{equation*}
	Simplifying \footnote{\label{note1}In this step the values of $C_1$ and $C_2$ might have changed, but they are still constants.},
	\begin{equation*}
		= e^{\alpha x}\left(C_1\cos{(\beta x)} + iC_2\sin{(\beta x)}\right)
	\end{equation*}
	At this point, we need to consider if the constants are real or imaginary. We would then take the real part as a fundamental solution.\\
	If they are both real, then a fundamental solution is\footnote{See footnote \ref{note1}}
	\begin{equation*}
		C_1e^{\alpha x}\cos{(\beta x)}
	\end{equation*}
	where $C_1$ is a real constant.
	If they are both imaginary, the a fundamental solution is\footnote{See footnote \ref{note1}}
	\begin{equation*}
		C_2e^{\alpha x}\sin{(\beta x)}
	\end{equation*}
	where $C_2$ is a real constant.
\end{proof}

\noindent
If complex roots are repeated, we just add the appropriate number of powers of $x$ in front of both the $\sin{(\beta x)}$ and $\cos{(\alpha a)}$ parts.
