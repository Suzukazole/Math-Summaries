\section{Constant Coefficients}
The general form of an nth order linear equation is
\begin{equation*}
	a_n(x)y^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1(x)y' + a_0y = b(x)
\end{equation*}
If each $a_i(x)$ is a constant, then the equation has constant coefficients.\\

\noindent
We already know how to solve linear first order differential equations using an integrating factor, but let's see if we can develop a method that can solve any order linear, homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients.
