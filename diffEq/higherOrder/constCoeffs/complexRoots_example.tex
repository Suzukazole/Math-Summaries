\begin{example}
	Find the general solution to the following differential equation.
	\begin{equation*}
		y^{(4)} + 2y^{\prime\prime} + y = 0
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}
First we extract the auxiliary equation and find its roots.
\begin{equation*}
	r^4 + 2r^2 + 1 = 0 \implies r = i (\text{double root}), -i (\text{double root})
\end{equation*}
Since we have complex roots $0 \pm 1i$, we know that the following are fundamental solutions
\begin{equation*}
	C_1e^{0x}\cos{1x} \to C_1\cos{x} \text{ and } C_2e^{0x}\sin{1x} \to C_2\sin{x}
\end{equation*}
Since both roots are double roots the following are also fundamental solutions.
\begin{equation*}
	C_3x\cos{x} \text{ and } C_4x\sin{x}
\end{equation*}
So, the general solution is
\begin{equation*}
	y = C_1\cos{x} + C_2\sin{x} + C_3x\cos{x} + C_4x\sin{x}
\end{equation*}
