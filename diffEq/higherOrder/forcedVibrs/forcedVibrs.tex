\section{Forced Vibrations}
\noindent
Now that we have some powerful methods for solving higher order equations, we can think about forced vibrations and understand ideas like beats and resonance.\\

\noindent
The equation we're trying to solve is
\begin{equation*}
	my^{\prime\prime} + by^{\prime} + ky = F_{\text{ext}}(t)
\end{equation*}
We'll assume that $F_{\text{ext}}(t) = F_0\cos{(\gamma t)}$ so our equation becomes.
\begin{equation*}
	my^{\prime\prime} + by^{\prime} + ky = F_0\cos{\gamma}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
We'll look at the undamped and damped cases separately.
