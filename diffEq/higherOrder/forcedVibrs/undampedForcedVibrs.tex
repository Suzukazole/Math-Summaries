\subsection{Undamped Forced Vibrations ($b = 0$)}
\noindent
Our equation now becomes
\begin{equation*}
	my'' + ky = F_0\cos{(\gamma t)}
\end{equation*}
We can use the method of undetermined coefficients to solve this system.\\

\noindent
Extracting the coefficients for the auxiliary equation and finding the roots,
\begin{equation*}
	mr^2 + k = 0 \implies r = \pm i\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = i\omega
\end{equation*}
So, our homogeneous solution is
\begin{equation*}
	y_h = C_1\cos{(\omega t)} + C_2\sin{(\omega t)}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
For guessing the form of $y_p$, we'll need to break into two cases depending on if $\omega = \gamma$. One case will give rise to beats and the other resonance.
