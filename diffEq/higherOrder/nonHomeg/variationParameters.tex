\subsection{Variation of Parameters}
\noindent
Although the method of undetermined coefficients is useful and relatively quick because it is algebra-based, it cannot solve many equations, even simple-looking second order equations, like
\begin{equation*}
	y'' + y = \csc{x}.
\end{equation*}
The method also requires guessing, meaning for very complicated forms of $b(x)$, things can get very messy.\\

\noindent
Instead, we'll look at a more rigorous, calculus-based, approach developed by Lagrange called ``variation of parameters.''
We'll first see how to apply the method to 2nd order linear ODEs with constant coefficients, like forced vibrations, and then we'll extend the method to order $n$.
