\subsubsection{Second Order Variation of Parameters}
\noindent
We'll modify our second order equation of have a 1 as the coefficient of the $y^{\prime\prime}$ term by dividing to get an equation of the form
\begin{equation*}
	y^{\prime\prime} + py^\prime + qy = g(x)
\end{equation*}
Just like for undetermined coefficients, we'll find homogeneous and particular solutions $y = y_h + y_p$. Since the equation is second-order, the solution to the homogeneous equation will yield two fundamental solutions $y_1$ and $y_2$ where $y_h = C_1y_1 + C_2y_2$.\\

\noindent
So, we can write $y$ as
\begin{equation*}
	y(x) = A(x)y_1 + B(x)y_2
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{cases}
		A^\prime y_1 + B^\prime y_2 = 0 \\
		A^\prime y_1^\prime + B^\prime y_2^\prime = g(x)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
We will then solve this system to solve for $A^\prime$ and $B^\prime$ and integrate.
