\subsection{Method of Undetermined Coefficients}
\noindent
The type of equation we're trying to solve is a heterogeneous linear ODE with constant coefficients.
These have the form
\begin{equation*}
	a_ny^{(n)} + a_{n-1}y^{(n-1)} + \ldots + a_1y' + a_0y = b(x).
\end{equation*}
We will assume that the solution has the form $y = y_h + y_p$, where $y_h$ is the general solution to the homogeneous equation ($b(x) = 0$), and $y_p$ is the particular solution.\\

\noindent
We know how to solve for $y_h$ exactly without guessing.
However, we will make a guess for the form of $y_p$ based on the form of $b(x)$ and the form of $y_h$ using the rules described in the below examples.
For each term in our guess for $y_p$, we will solve for a constant.\\
