\section{Higher Order Heterogeneous Equations}
\noindent
If we modify our equation for free vibrations to have a function as the net force, then out equations becomes
\begin{equation*}
	my'' + by' + ky = b(x)
\end{equation*}
Depending on the form of $b(x)$, like a $\sin$ or $\cos$ curve or an exponential, we might be able to guess the form of the solution. However, there is an important thing to keep in mind.

\begin{theorem}
	If $f(x)$ is a solution to the above equation, and $g(x)$ is a solution to the homogeneous form of the equation $b(x) = 0$, then $f(x) + g(x)$ is also a solution to the above equation.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
	If $f(x) + g(x)$ is a solution, then
	\begin{equation*}
		m\left(f(x) + g(x)\right)'' + b\left(f(x) + g(x)\right)' + k\left(f(x) + g(x)\right) = b(x)
	\end{equation*}
	Rearranging,
	\begin{equation*}
		\left(mf''(x) + bf'(x) + kf(x)\right) + \left(mg''(x) + bg'(x) + kg(x)\right) = 0
	\end{equation*}
	Using the definitions of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$,
	\begin{equation*}
		b(x) + 0 = b(x)
	\end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\noindent
$f(x)$ and $g(x)$ actually have special meanings in terms of solving these higher-order equations.
\begin{definition}
	$f(x)$ is called the particular solution to the heterogeneous equation, and $g(x)$ is called a homogeneous solution.
\end{definition}
