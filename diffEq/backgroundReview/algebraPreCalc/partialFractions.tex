\subsection{Partial Fractions}
\noindent
If we have a function of two polynomials $f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$, it's often easier to break this quotient into a sum of parts where the denominator is a linear or quadratic factor and the numerator is always a smaller degree than the denominator.

\begin{example}
	\begin{equation*}
		\frac{2x-1}{x^3-6x^2+11x-6} = \frac{1/2}{x-1}+\frac{-3}{x-2}+\frac{5/2}{x-3}.
	\end{equation*}
\end{example}

\noindent
One natural way to find these small denominators comes from the linear factors of the denominator where we keep quadratics with complex roots.
This way, when making a common denominator, we get back the original big denominator.
However, there are a few special cases we have to take care of.
