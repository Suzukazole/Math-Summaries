\subsubsection{Repeated Quadratic Factors}
\noindent
If a quadratic factor that can't be broken into linear factors is repeated, then we can write
\begin{equation*}
	Q(x) = R(x)(ax^2+bx+c)^k\text{, }b^2-4ac < 0\text{, }k \geq 0\text{, and }R(x)\text{ is not divisible by }(ax^2+bx+c)^k
\end{equation*}
Now we have to do a combination of what we did for repeated linear factors and quadratic factors. We say
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{P(x)}{R(x)(ax^2+bx+c)^k}=\left(\text{Decomposition of }R(x)\right)+\frac{A_1x+B_1}{ax^2+bx+c}+\ldots+\frac{A_kx+B_k}{(ax^2+bx+c)^k}
\end{equation*}
and then solve for the coefficients in the numerator.
