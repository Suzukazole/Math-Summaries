\subsubsection{Repeated Linear Factors}
\noindent
If $Q(x)$ has repeated roots, it factors into
\begin{equation*}
	Q(x) = R(x)(x-a)^k\text{, }k \geq 2\text{ and }R(a) \neq 0
\end{equation*}
When making the common denominator for each repeated root of multiplicity $k$, we do
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{P(x)}{R(x)(x-a)^k} = \left(\text{Decomposition of }R(x)\right) + \frac{A_1}{x-a}+\ldots+\frac{A_k}{(x-a)^k}
\end{equation*}
You would then multiply each side by the denominator like in the linear factors case and solve for the coefficients. The only additional difficulty is that you might have to use previous results or solve a system of linear equations to get some of the constants.
