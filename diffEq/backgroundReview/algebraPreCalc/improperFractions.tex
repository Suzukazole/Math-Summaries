\subsubsection{Improper Fractions}
\noindent
If the degree of the numerator is greater than or equal to the degree of the denominator, we have a case of improper fractions. In this case, we have to do polynomial long division to get a quotient and remainder and then decompose the remainder if necessary. So,
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} = R(x) + \frac{S(x)}{Q(x)}
\end{equation*}
