\subsubsection{Quadratic Factors}
\noindent
If a quadratic doesn't have real roots, then we have a quadratic factor. Here, we'll assume that the quadratic factor isn't repeated. 
So, 
\begin{equation*}
	Q(x) = R(x)(ax^2+bx+c)\text{, }b^2-4ac < 0\text{, and }R(x)\text{ is not divisible by }ax^2+bx+c
\end{equation*}
In this case, we say
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{P(x)}{R(x)(ax^2+bx+c)} = \left(\text{Decomposition of }R(x)\right)+\frac{A_1x+B_1}{ax^2+bx+c}
\end{equation*}
and then solve for the constants in the numerator, possibly having to solve a system of equations or using previous resultss and less convenient values for $x$.
