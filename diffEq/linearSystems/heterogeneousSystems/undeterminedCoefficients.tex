\subsection{Method of Undetermined Coefficients}
\noindent
The rules for undetermined coefficients are very similar for systems and single equations. Let's say we have a heterogeneous system of the form
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{cases}
		x_1' = a_{11}x_1 + \ldots + a_{1n}x_n + f_1(t) \\
		\vdots \\
		x_n' = a_{n1}x_n + \ldots + a_{nn}x_n + f_n(t)
	\end{cases}
\end{equation*}
written in a matrix form,
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{bmatrix}
		x_1' \\
		\vdots \\
		x_n'
	\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
		a_{11} & \ldots & a_{1n} \\
		\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
		a_{n1} & \ldots & a_{nn}
	\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
		x_1 \\
		\vdots \\
		x_n
	\end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix}
		f_1(t) \\
		\vdots \\
		f_n(t)
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
or more compactly as
\begin{equation*}
	\vec{x}' = A\vec{x} + \vec{f}
\end{equation*}
All we need to do is look at each $f_i(t)$ and write in the $i^{th}$ blank the corresponding guess. This is like doing undetermined coefficients on each equation in the system.\\

\noindent
This is especially nice when all the $f_i(t)$'s have a similar form because we can write our guess as
\begin{equation*}
	\vec{g}(t) = f_c(t)\vec{v}
\end{equation*}
where $f_c(t)$ is the guess corresponding to $f$ and $\vec{c}$ is a vector of undetermined scalars.
