\section{Heterogeneous Systems}
\noindent
Now that we know how to solve the "easy case" of homogeneous systems of linear differential equations, we can tackle the general case of heterogeneous systems. Much like for single equations, we'll look for a homogeneous solution and particular solution, and we'll use undetermined coefficients or variation of parameters to find the particular solution. These methods will then lead into seeing how systems of first order equations relate to single higher order equations.
