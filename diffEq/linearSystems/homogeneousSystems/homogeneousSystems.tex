\section{Homogeneous Systems}
\noindent
Homogeneous systems of linear equations have the form
\begin{equation*}
	\vec{x}' = A\vec{x}
\end{equation*}
We'll see how to find solutions to these types of systems using the eigenvalue method.
Finding solutions to these systems will allow us to find homogeneous solutions to heterogeneous systems of equations.
