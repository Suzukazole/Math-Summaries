\section{Solutions to Systems}
\noindent
Just like with a single differential equation, we need to define exactly what a solution to a differential equation looks like.
\begin{definition}
	A solution on an interval $I$ is a vector $\vec{x}$ that satisfies the system of differential equations.
\end{definition}

\noindent
We also need to define some common terms like homogeneous and heterogeneous.
\begin{definition}
	If a linear system of differential equations written in the form $\vec{x}^\prime = A\vec{x} + \vec{f}$ where $\vec{f} = \vec{0}$, then the system is homogeneous. Else, the system is heterogeneous.
\end{definition}
