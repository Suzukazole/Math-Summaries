\subsubsection{Magnetic Fields}
\noindent
Gauss's Law for magnetism says that that magnetic flux through a closed surface is 0. Rewritten more formally, 
\begin{equation*}
	\oint\limits_{S}\oint{\vec{B} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{s}} = 0.
\end{equation*}
So, 
\begin{equation*}
	\iiint\limits_{V}{\nabla \cdot \vec{B}\mathrm{d}V} = \iiint\limits_{V}{0\mathrm{d}V}.
\end{equation*}
If we let $V \to 0$, 
\begin{equation*}
	\nabla \cdot \vec{B} = 0.
\end{equation*}
This means that there are no lone sources or sinks in magnetic fields. You may also hear this law summarized as ``There are no magnetic monopoles.'' This is the 2nd of Maxwell's Equations.
