\subsubsection{Curl \& Conservative Vector Fields}
\begin{theorem}
	$\vec{F}$ is conservative $\Leftrightarrow\nabla\times\vec{F} = \vec{0}$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}[Partial Proof]
	We will prove the 2D case and provide intuition for higher dimensions.\\
	Let $\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle P(x,y), Q(x,y)\rangle$ be a conservative vector field.\\
	Since $\vec{F}$ is conservative, $P_y = Q_x$.\\
	So, $\nabla \times \vec{F}=Q_x-P_y=0$.
\end{proof}

\noindent
Thinking back to what it means for a vector field to be conservative, a vector field must have path independence between all points to have a potential function and be conservative. If in some plane there is a net rotation, there cannot be path independence because one can choose one path that goes “with” the field and another that goes “against” the field.
