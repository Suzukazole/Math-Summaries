\section{Integral Curves}
\noindent
An integral curve, $\vec{r}$, of a vector field, $\vec{F}$, is a VVF such that $\vec{r^\prime}(t) = \left(\vec{F}\circ\vec{r}\right)(t)$.\\

\noindent
For example, let's find an integral curve to $\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle x, 2y\rangle$.
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\vec{r}(t) = \vec{F}\circ\vec{r}	
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\langle x(t), y(t) \rangle = \langle x(t), 2 y(t) \rangle \to
	\begin{cases}
		x^\prime(t) = x(t) \\
		y^\prime(t) = 2 y(t)
	\end{cases} 
	\implies \vec{r}(t) = \langle c_1 e^t, c_2 e^{2t} \rangle
\end{equation*}

\noindent
These integral curves have applications in physics and show up naturally in nature alongside vector fields. In physics, the integral curves for an electric field are called “field lines” and integral curves of the velocity field of a fluid like water or air are called “streamlines.” You may recognize these curves as tracing out a slope field.
