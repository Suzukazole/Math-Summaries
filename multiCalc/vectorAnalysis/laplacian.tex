\subsubsection{The Laplacian}
The Laplacian is the higher dimension version of concavity. Let $f$ be a scalar function, We say that $\nabla^2 f = \nabla \cdot (\nabla f) = \text{div} (\text{grad}(f))$. Written out more fully,
\begin{equation*}
	\nabla^2 f = f_{xx} + f_{yy} + \ldots
\end{equation*}
