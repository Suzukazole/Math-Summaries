\subsection{Test for a Conservative Vector Field}
\noindent
Since we know that all conservative vector fields have potential function, we can create a test to see if a given vector field is conservative. $\vec{F}_{\text{Conservative}} = \langle f_x, f_y \rangle$, so $f_{xy} = f_{yx}$. That is, a vector field $\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle P(x,y), Q(x,y) \rangle$ is conservative if $P_y = Q_x$.\\
For 3D vector field, the test is a little more complicated. A vector field $\vec{F}\langle P(x,y,z), Q(x,y,z), R(x,y,z)\rangle$ is conservative if $P_y = Q_x$, $Q_z = R_y$, and $R_x = P_z$.\\

\noindent
For example, let see if $\langle yz, xz, xy\rangle$ is conservative.
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial y}yz = z = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}xz
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial z}xz = x = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}xy
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
	\frac{\partial}{\partial y}xy = y = \frac{\partial}{\partial z}yz
\end{equation*}
So, the vector field is conservative.
