\subsubsection{Direction Matters}
\noindent
\begin{lemma}
	\begin{equation*}
		\int\limits_{-C}{\vec{F} \cdot \mathrm{d}\vec{r}} = -\int\limits_{C}{\vec{F}\mathrm{d}\vec{r}}
	\end{equation*}
\end{lemma}
That is, the direction in which one takes a line integral matters. You can think of this as the wind helping you sail in one direction (positive line integral) but fighting against you in the opposite direction (negative line integral).
