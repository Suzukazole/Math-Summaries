\section{Vector Fields}
\noindent
Vector fields are a function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$. This is generally conceptualized as assigning an n-dimensional vector to every point in an n-dimensional space.\\
Many physics concepts can be thought of as vector fields. The electric field due to some point charge $Q$ as some distance $r$ from $Q$ is $\vec{E}(x,y,z) = \frac{\epsilon_{0}Q}{r^2}\hat{r}$ where $\epsilon_{0}$ is a constant and $\hat{r}$ is a radial unit vector pointing away from $Q$.

A generic 2D vector field is 
\begin{equation*}
	\vec{F}(x,y) = \langle P(x,y), Q(x,y) \rangle.
\end{equation*}
Vector fields work similarly to VVFs in that they are added component-wise.
