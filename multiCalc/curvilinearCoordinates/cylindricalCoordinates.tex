\section{Cylindrical Coordinates}
\noindent
Cylindrical coordinates are the expansion of polar coordinates by including a third term that represents the height from the xy-plane, $z$. All cylindrical coordinates have the form $(r, \theta, z)$. This system is called cylindrical because itâ€™s easy to describe shapes with cylindrical symmetry because integrations have constant, independent bounds.
