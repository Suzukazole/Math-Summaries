\subsection{Lines}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lines through the origin can be represented as $\theta = \tan^{-1}{m}$ where $m$ is the slope of the line.
	\item Lines of the form $x = a$ can be represented as $r = a\sec{\theta}$.
	\item Lines of the form $y = a$ can be represented as $r = a\csc{\theta}$.
	\item All other lines of the form $y=ax+b$ can be represented as $r = \frac{b}{\sin{\theta} - a\cos{\theta}}$. This form also covers the previous 2.
\end{itemize}
