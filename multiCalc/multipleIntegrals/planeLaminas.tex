\subsection{Plane Laminas}
\begin{definition}
	A plane lamina is an idealized 2D (0 thickness) object with mass that occupies a region $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{definition}

\noindent
Some questions one may ask about a plane lamina are "What is the total mass?" and "Where is the center of mass?".\\
We can think of the mass as $$M = \iint\limits_{D}{\sigma(x,y)\mathrm{d}A}$$ where $\sigma(x,y)$ is the mass density of the lamina at $(x,y)$.\\
The center of mass is
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ccc}
	 	$\bar{x} = \frac{M_y}{M} = \frac{\iint\limits_{D}{x\sigma(x,y)\mathrm{d}A}}{M}$ & and & $\bar{y} = \frac{M_x}{M} = \frac{\iint\limits_{D}{y\sigma(x,y)\mathrm{d}A}}{M}$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
where $M_x$ is the moment about the $x$-axis and $M_y$ is the moment about the $y$-axis.
