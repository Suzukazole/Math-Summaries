\subsection{Hyperboloids}
\noindent
A hyperboloid looks like a hyperbola that has been rotated and extruded about its center. It is also radially symmetric with circular level curves. Paraboloids have the form $d = \pm \frac{x^2}{a^2} \pm \frac{y^2}{b^2} \pm \frac{z^2}{c^2}$ where one sign is different from the others. Depending on the signs and the value of $d$, one can get a hyperboloid of one sheet, two sheets, or a cone.
