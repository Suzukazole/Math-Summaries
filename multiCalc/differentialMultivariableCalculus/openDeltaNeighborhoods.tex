\subsection{Open Delta Neighborhoods}
\noindent
An open delta neighborhood of a point $x_0$ is defined as the set
\begin{equation*}
	N\left(x_0, \delta\right) = \left\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n \mid \norm{x-x_0} < \delta\right\}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
This simply means all points less than a distance $\delta$ away from $x_0$.\\
For example, $N(\langle 1, 2\rangle, 7) = \left\{ (x,y) \mid \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-2)^2}<7 \right\}$, which is a ball (filled-in circle) of radius 7 centered at $(1, 2)$.
