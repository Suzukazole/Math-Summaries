\subsection{Dot Products}
\noindent
A dot product is a way of multiplying two vectors so that the result is a scalar. $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = \norm{\vec{a}}\norm{\vec{b}}\cos{\theta}$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$. One way to think of the dot product is as a measure of how much two vectors point in the same direction.\\
We can also show using the law of cosines that $\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = a_1b_1+a_2b_2+...+a_nb_n$.\\
Knowing the lengths of two vectors and their dot product we can calculate the angle between them as
\begin{equation*}
	\theta = \arccos{\left(\frac{\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b}}{\norm{\vec{a}} \norm{\vec{b}}}\right)}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
Although similar to scalar multiplication, dot products have some properties that set them apart.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Commutative
		\begin{equation*}
			\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b} = \vec{b}\cdot\vec{a}	
		\end{equation*}
		the same as scalar multiplication.
	\item Distributive
		\begin{equation*}
			\vec{a}\cdot\left(\vec{b}+\vec{c}\right) = \vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}+\vec{a}\cdot\vec{c}
		\end{equation*}
		the same as scalar multiplication.
	\item \textbf{NOT} Associative $\left(\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\right)\cdot\vec{c}$ is a nonsense expression. However, like scalar multiplication, dot products are scalar associative.
	\begin{equation*}
		\left(c\cdot\vec{a}\right)\cdot\vec{b} = \vec{a}\cdot\left(c\cdot\vec{b}\right)
	\end{equation*}
\end{itemize}
