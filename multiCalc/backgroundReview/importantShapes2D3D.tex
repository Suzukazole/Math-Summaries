\section{Important Shapes in 2D \& 3D}
\noindent
In 2D space $(\R^2)$, the most common and simple shapes you will encounter are lines and circles.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lines have a form like $x=1$ or $y=2x+1$.
	\item Circles have a form like $\left(x-1\right)^2 + \left(y-2\right)^2 = 9$.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
In 3D space $(R^3)$, these 2D shapes have higher dimensional versions: planes, cylinders, and spheres.
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Planes have forms like $x = 1$, $y = 2x+1$, and $z = 2x+3y+5$.\\
		\small{Note the similarity to the equation for lines. One can think of a plane as a line extruded in a direction.}}
	\item{Cylinders have forms like $\left(x-4\right)^2 + \left(y-5\right)^2 = 36$.\\
		\small{Note the similarity to the equation for circles. One can think of a cylinder as a circle extruded away from it's face.}}
	\item{Spheres have forms like $\left(x-7\right)^2 + \left(y-8\right)^2 + \left(z-9\right)^2 = 100$.\\
		\small{Note the similarity to the equations for circles. One can think of a sphere as a circle rotated and extruded about its center.}}
