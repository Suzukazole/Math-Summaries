\section{Integrals of VVFs}
VVFs can also be integrated. The integration operation also distributes inside the vector, for both definite and indefinite integrals.
\begin{equation*}
	\int{\vec{r}(t)\mathrm{d}t} = \left<\int{x(t)\mathrm{d}t},\int{y(t)\mathrm{d}t},\int{z(t)\mathrm{d}t}\right>
\end{equation*}
For indefinite integrals, the result will have a vector of constants will be added.
