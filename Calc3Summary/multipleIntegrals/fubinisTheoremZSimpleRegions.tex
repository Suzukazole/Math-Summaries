\subsection{Fubini's Theorem for Z-simple Regions}
\noindent
There is another case of Fubiniâ€™s Theorem that arises in 3D.\\
\begin{theorem}[Fubini's Theorem for Z-simple Regions]
	Let $D\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ and let $\Omega=\left\{(x,y,z)|(x,y)\in D, g(x,y)\leq z\leq h(x,y)\right\}$ be a z-simple region.\\
	$$\iiint\limits_{\Omega}{f(x,y,z)\mathrm{d}V}=\iint\limits_{D}{\int_{g(x,y)}^{h(x,y)}{f(x,y,z)\mathrm{d}z}\mathrm{d}A}$$
\end{theorem}

\noindent
In other words, dependent variables must be integrated before the independent variables on which they rely, but the order of integration of independent variables doesn't matter.\\

\noindent
For example, we an express the unit sphere as a z-simple region where $D=\left\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2\leq 1\right\}$ and $-\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}\leq z\leq\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$. Note that $D$ is a Type I Region.\\
$$V_{\text{sphere}}=\int_{-1}^{1}{\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}}{\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}}{\mathrm{d}z}\mathrm{d}x}\mathrm{d}x}=\frac{4\pi}{3}$$
