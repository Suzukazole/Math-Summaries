\subsection{Open Delta Neighborhoods}
\noindent
An open delta nieghborhood of a point $x_0$ is defined as the set $$N\left(x_0, \delta\right)=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^n|\norm{x-x_0}<\delta\right\}$$

[INSERT IMAGE]

\noindent
This simply means all points less than a distance $\delta$ away from $x_0$.\\
For example, $N(\langle 1,2\rangle , 7)=\left\{(x,y)|\sqrt{(x-1)^2+(y-2)^2}<7\right\}$, which is a ball (filled-in circle) of radius 7 centered at $(1,2)$.
