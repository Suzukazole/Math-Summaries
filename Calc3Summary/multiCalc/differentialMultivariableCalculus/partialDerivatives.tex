\section{Partial Derivatives}
\noindent
The single-variable calculus idea of tangent lines doesn't work for higher dimensional surfaces because we can draw many different lines that are tangent to the surface, depending on which plane we use to slice the surface. That is, from which direction we approach the surface.
