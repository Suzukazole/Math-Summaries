\subsection{Linear Approximations}
\noindent
Since $\partial z=f_x\partial x + f_y\partial y$, we can approximate $\Delta z$ (the change in any function) as $\Delta z \approx f_x\Delta x+f_y\Delta y$, since values of $f$ and the tangent plane are close. We an rewrite this approximation as a dot product: $\Delta z \approx \langle f_x, f_y\rangle\cdot\langle \Delta x, \Delta y\rangle$.\\
For example, say a cylindrical can has a radius $r=1$ and a height $h=5$. If the radius is increased by .1 and the height is increased by 1, what is the approximate $\Delta V$?\\
\indent
$V(r,h)=\pi r^2 h$, $V_r=2\pi rh$, $V_h=\pi r^2$\\
\indent
$V_{r}(1,5)=10\pi$, $V_{h}(1,5)=\pi$\\
\indent
$\Delta V\approx 10\pi(.1)+\pi(1)=2\pi$\\
\indent
$\small{\text{Comparing this to the actual answer of }2.26\pi\text{, we see our approximation is decent.}}$
