\subsection{Ellipsoids}
\noindent
Ellipsoids look like ellipses that have been rotated and extruded about their axis. They are radially symmetric about this axis. They have the general form $d=\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}$. Note that the only difference in the equation between an ellipsoid and hyperboloid is the signs.
