\section{Spherical Coordinates}
\noindent
Unlike how cylindrical coordinates extend polar coordinates into 3D by adding a Cartesian term, spherical coordinates add an angular term, $\phi$, the azimuthal angle. All spherical coordinates have the form $(\rho,\theta,\phi)$ where $\rho$ is the distance from the origin, $\theta$ is the polar angle in the xy-plane, and $\phi$ is the azimuthal angle from the $+z$-axis. Shapes with spherical symmetry have a constant bounds of integration in spherical coordinates.
