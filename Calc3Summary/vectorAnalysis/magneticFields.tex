\subsubsection{Magnetic Fields}
\noindent
Gauss's Law for magnetism says that that magnetic flux through a closed surface is 0.\\
Rewritten more formally, $\oint\limits_{S}\oint{\vec{B}\cdot\mathrm{d}\vec{s}}=0$.\\
So, $\iiint\limits_{V}{\nabla\cdot\vec{B}\mathrm{d}V}=\iiint\limits_{V}{0\mathrm{d}V}$.\\
If we let $V\to 0$, $\nabla\cdot\vec{B}=0$. This means that there are no lone sources or sinks in magentic fields. You may also hear this law summarized as "There are no magnetic monopoles." This is the 2nd of Maxwell's Equations.
