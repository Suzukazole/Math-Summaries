\section{Green's Theorems}
\noindent
Similar to how we had the fundamental theorem of calculus (FTC) for single-variable calculus, there are several higher-dimensional versions of the FTC.\\
Recall that the fundamental theorem of calculus is $\int_{a}^{b}{f^\prime(x)\mathrm{d}x}=f(b)-f(a)$. One way to think of this statement is “summing up the derivative on a closed interval is the same as the ‘sum’ of $f$ on the boundary.” We will see that many of these higher versions of the FTC deal with intervals and boundaries.
