\section{Multivariable Functions}
\noindent
Multivariable functions take several values as an input and return a single value as an output.\\
For example, $z=x^2+y^2$ takes $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathrm{R}$.\\
Although we can only graph and fully visualize up to $\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$ as a surface, we can imagine a multivariable function with 3 inputs ($\mathbb{R}^3\to\mathbb{R}$) as a heatmap in 3D space. However, most of the mathematics we will discuss applies to functions with any number of inputs.\\

\noindent
The domain of a multivariable function $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}$ is the largest set of points on which $f$ is defined.\\
For example, if $f(x,y)=\ln{\left(9-x^2-y^2\right)}$, the domain of $f(x,y)$ is $\left\{(x,y)|x^2+y^2<9\right\}$.
