\section{Limits \& Continuity in 3D}
\noindent
Limits in single-variable calculus are relatively simple because thera are only two ways to approach a point on a curve: left and right. When dealing with a surface, there are infinitely many ways to approach a point. So, we need a general and more formal idea of limits that works in higher dimensions.
