\section{Lines \& Planes as VVFs}
\noindent
VVFs are parametric equations that take one input value and return one or more output values as a vector. We can draw curves in space by defining the tail of the output of the VVF be at the origin and have the tip trace out the curve. We will look at some simple VVFs that you need to be able to recognize.\\
